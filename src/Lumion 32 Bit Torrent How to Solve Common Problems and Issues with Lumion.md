## What is Torrent?
 
Torrent is a file-sharing protocol that allows users to download large files from multiple sources at the same time. It works by splitting the file into small pieces and distributing them among different peers who have the same file or parts of it. This way, the download speed is faster and more efficient than using a single server.
 
To use torrent, you need two things: a torrent client and a torrent file. A torrent client is a software that manages the download process and connects you to other peers. A torrent file is a small file that contains information about the file you want to download, such as its name, size, and location.
